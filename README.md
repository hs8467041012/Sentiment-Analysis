Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

This repository contains a Sentiment Analysis project developed as part of my academic and resume projects, focusing on extracting meaningful insights from customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The project analyzes textual reviews and classifies them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, helping businesses understand customer opinions and improve decision-making.

Project Overview
Customer feedback plays a crucial role in improving products and services. However, manually analyzing thousands of reviews is inefficient.
This project automates the process by applying text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models to determine customer sentiment from raw textual data.

This project demonstrates:
Strong understanding of NLP fundamentals
Practical application of machine learning for text classification
End-to-end ML workflow in a Jupyter Notebook

Objectives:
Analyze customer reviews using NLP techniques
Classify reviews based on sentiment polarity
Preprocess unstructured text data effectively
Train and evaluate a sentiment classification model
Visualize sentiment distribution and insights

Key Features:
Text preprocessing (cleaning & normalization)
 Tokenization & stopword removal
 Feature extraction using vectorization techniques
 Machine Learning-based sentiment classification
 Model evaluation & performance analysis
 Fully documented Jupyter Notebook

 Technical Workflow
 1. Data Preprocessing
Removal of punctuation and special characters
Lowercasing text
Stopword removal
Tokenization
Text normalization

 2. Feature Extraction
Conversion of text into numerical format using:
Bag of Words (BoW) / TF-IDF (as applicable)

 3. Model Building
Machine learning classifier trained on processed text
Supervised learning approach for sentiment prediction

 4. Model Evaluation
Accuracy measurement
Analysis of correctly vs incorrectly classified reviews
Visualization of sentiment distribution

 Technologies & Libraries Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
